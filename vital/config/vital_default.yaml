# IMPORTANT NOTE: When using a local checkpoint with a relative path add the working_dir to the checkpoint path because
# hydra will change the current working directory. For example:
# If defined in the config:  `ckpt: ${work_dir}/path/to/checkpoint.ckpt`
# If defined in the command line: `ckpt=\${work_dir}/path/to/checkpoint.ckpt`
