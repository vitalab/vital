    refs), with the difference that the actual equation is a differentiable (i.e. `loss`) version of the score.

        target: (N, H, W), Groundtruth labels, where each value is 0 <= targets[i] <= C-1.
        beta: Weight to apply to false positives, and complement of the weight to apply to false negatives.
        bg: Whether to also compute the dice score for the background.
        nan_score: Score to return, if a NaN occurs during computation (denom zero).
        no_fg_score: Score to return, if no foreground pixel was found in target.
        reduction: Method for reducing metric score over labels.
            Available reduction methods:
            - ``'elementwise_mean'``: takes the mean (default)
            - ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied
