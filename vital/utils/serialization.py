def resolve_model_checkpoint_path(checkpoint: Union[str, Path]) -> Path:
    """Resolves a local path or a Comet model registry query to a local path on the machine.

    Notes:
        - If the `ckpt` is to be downloaded off of a Comet model registry, your Comet API key needs to be set in one of
          Comet's expected locations: https://www.comet.ml/docs/python-sdk/advanced/#non-interactive-setup

    Args:
        checkpoint: Location of the checkpoint. This can be either a local path, or the fields of a query to a Comet
            model registry. Examples of different queries:
                - For the latest version of the model: 'my_workspace/my_model'
                - Using a specific version/stage: 'my_workspace/my_model/0.1.0' or 'my_workspace/my_model/prod'

    Returns:
        Path to the model's checkpoint file on the local computer. This can either be the `ckpt` already provided, if it
        was already local, or the location where the checkpoint was downloaded, if it pointed to a Comet registry model.
